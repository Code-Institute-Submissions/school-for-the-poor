# **Miss Kate's Academy**

# introduction

This project has been created so that users can play a game that tests their Enlish language skills. 
It is currently based around forming questions, a notoriously difficult part of English language learning.
The site provides the information about real-life English language schools which the users can then 
contact to enquire about English classes.  

The site provides contact details and a form so customers can quickly and easily contact the school. 

# ux

-  **strategy** - the site is simple, with a fun design that reflects learning from a blackboard
in an old skool classroom. The instructions for the game are clear and it offers multiple levels to reflect
the differing abilities of users and to add progression. The game shows a entertaining element to leanguage learning,
 so the users can anticipate that lessons in the real-life classrooms won't be boring. 
The site is simple with functional content that acheives the site owner's and users' goals. It's easy to
then contact the site owner to enquire about the school and lessons. 
- **scope** - 

- **structure** - the site has a consistent theme and style with the site name as a home page link and 
a menu at the top right. All clickable links have clear actions and responses. The pages are designed to be viewed on 
a single screen view so it is easy to know where you are, or how to get where you want to be. 
- **skeleton** - information is revealed across a small number of pages, with the key part of the site in the 
first view.  The limited number of pages keeps the site simple and easy to navigate beyond the game and find the 
information the user needs. 
- **surface** -

# technologies used

- HTML: layout and content 
- CSS: styling
- Font Awesome: icons that visually represent the services the business offers https://fontawesome.com
- Google Fonts: a font family that represents the style and deign of the business https://fonts.google.com
- Bootstrap (CSS, JavaScript and JQuery) for the functionality of the sticky navbar, hamburger menu 
    and the grid structuring of the site https://bootstrapcdn.com

# testing

- links

All links have been checked - links to sections in the menu and links to local images. 
The links to external sites display a "coming soon" image as the social media for the business
has not yet been created. 

- get a quote form

On submission the form comes up with an error if it hasn't been filled in correctly (email address), 
or if required information (name, email address and details in the text box) is missing. The form doesn't yet submit information anywhere so there is no feedback 
for a response. 
In a future version the form data will be sent as an email to the site owner.  

- responsiveness

At every stage of the development process the responsiveness of the site has been checked (within gitpod and google inspect) as 
the grid structuring uses responsive parameters for display effectiveness i.e. the "what we do" and "testimonials" sections
are displayed as a single column on mobile and as two columns for a medium screen width and four columns for a large screen width.
The site has also been tested on different browsers e.g. Chrome, Firefox, IE.  

- code errors

HTML and CSS have been run through validators to identify any missed errors

# deployment

The site has been deployed on the developer's GitHub site through GitHub Pages.

Files added to the GitHub repository (git add)

Files then commited to the respository (git commit)

Files then pushed to GitHub (git push)

The site can be accessed at https://github.com/junokili/school-for-the-poor
